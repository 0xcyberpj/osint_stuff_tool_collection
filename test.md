 <h1>Welcome to <a class="btn btn-primary" role="button" href="https://twitter.com/cyb_detective">@cyb_detective</a> OSINT tools collection</h1>
            <p>I've been running my Twitter account Osint Stuff (@Ivan30394639) since <b>6 April 2021</b>. And now (<b>11 October 2021</b>) <b>576</b> different tools have already been published in it. I've decided to collect them all on a separate page to make it easier for my regular readers to find them.</p>
            <p style="color:red">Ðœy Twitter account @ivan30394639 was blocked by the Twitter administration without explanation and without the possibility of restoration. Please subscribe to my new account @cyb_detective if you want to know news about Open Source Intelligence tools.</p>
            <p>I apologise in advance for: spelling and grammatical errors, confusion in the definition of a category (one service may fit into several categories, but is only placed in one), unnecessary spaces and other layout defects. I'm going to do a lot more work on this collection. Thank you very much for listening and for <b>retweeting</b> my tweets!
<p>If you would like to receive a list of new instruments added to your collection 2-3 times a month, please subscribe to<a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/cyb_detective?via=twitter-profile-webview"> email newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>This page contains universal and global tools (with a few exceptions). You can find tools for individual countries and cities at <a href="https://cipher387.github.io/osintmap/">Worldwide OSINT tools map</a>.</p>
