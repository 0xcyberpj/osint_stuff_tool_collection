 <h1>Welcome to <a class="btn btn-primary" role="button" href="https://twitter.com/cyb_detective">@cyb_detective</a> OSINT tools collection</h1>
            <p>I've been running my Twitter account Osint Stuff (@Ivan30394639) since <b>6 April 2021</b>. And now (<b>11 October 2021</b>) <b>576</b> different tools have already been published in it. I've decided to collect them all on a separate page to make it easier for my regular readers to find them.</p>

            <p>I apologise in advance for: spelling and grammatical errors, confusion in the definition of a category (one service may fit into several categories, but is only placed in one), unnecessary spaces and other layout defects. I'm going to do a lot more work on this collection. Thank you very much for listening and for <b>retweeting</b> my tweets!
